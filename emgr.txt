        The interim fix manager installs packages created with the
        epkg command and maintains a database containing interim fix
        information. It can perform the following operations install,
        commit, check, mount, unmount, remove, list interim fix and
        view package locks.

OPTIONS (= is mandatory):

- action
        Controls what is performed.
        `install' performs an install of specified interim fix package
        `commit' performs a commit operation of the specified interim
        fix.
        `check' performs a check operation on installed interim fix.
        `mount' mounts specified interim fix that have been mount-
        installed
        `unmount' unmounts specified interim fix that have been mount-
        installed
        `remove' performs an uninstall of the specified interim fix.
        `view_package' displays all packages that are locked, their
        installer, and the locking label or labels.
        `display_ifix' displays the contents and topology of specified
        interim fix. This option is useful with `verbose'.
        `list' lists interim fix data

        view_package, display_ifix, list)[Default: list]
        type: str

        `load_debugger' loads the low-level debugger during AIX
        bosboot.
        `invoke_debugger' invoke the low-level debugger for AIX
        bosboot.

        insufficient space.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

        Forces action.
        Can be used if `action' has one of following values `install',
        `remove'.
        When used `action=install', it specifies the interim fix
        installation can overwrite an existing package.
        When used `action=remove', it should be considered an
        emergency procedure because this method can create
        inconsistencies on the system.
        [Default: False]

        Required if `action==remove' and `force=True'.
        Mutually exclusive with `ifix_number', `ifix_vuid',

        type: str

- ifix_package
        Specifies the path of the interim fix package file.
        If `from_epkg=yes', then the file must be created with the
        epkg command and must end with the 16-bit compression
        extension, .Z. Otherwise the file is manage as a concurrent

- mount_install
        Perform a mount installation. When and interim fix is mount-
