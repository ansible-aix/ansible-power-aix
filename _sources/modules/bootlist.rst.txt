bootlist -- Alters the list of boot devices available to the system
===================================================================

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------

Alters the list of possible boot devices from which the system may be booted. When the system is booted, it will scan the devices in the list and attempt to boot from the first device it finds containing a boot image.



Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- AIX >= 7.1 TL3
- Python >= 2.7



Parameters
----------

  force (optional, bool, False)
    Indicates that the boot list must be modified even if the validation of the *speed* and *duplex* attributes, if specified, is not possible.


  normal (optional, list, None)
    Normal boot list. The normal list designates possible boot devices for when the system is booted in normal mode.

    Mutually exclusive with *both*.


    device (True, str, None)
      Specifies the name of the specific or generic device to include in the boot list.

      The following generic device keywords are supported:

      ``fd`` specifies any standard I/O-attached diskette drive.

      ``scdisk`` specifies any SCSI-attached disk.

      ``badisk`` specifes any direct bus-attached disk.

      ``cd`` specifies any SCSI-attached CD-ROM.

      ``rmt`` specifies any SCSI-attached tape device.

      ``ent`` specifies any Ethernet adapter.

    blv (optional, str, None)
      Specifies the boot logical volume on the target disk that is to be included in the boot list.


    pathid (optional, str, None)
      Specifies the path ID of the target disk.

      You can specify one or more path IDs by entering a comma-separated list of the required paths to be added to the boot list.


    bserver (optional, str, None)
      Specifies the IP address of the BOOTP server.


    gateway (optional, str, None)
      Specifies the IP address of the gateway.


    client (optional, str, None)

      Specifies the virtual local area network (VLAN) identification value.


    vlan_pri (optional, int, None)
      Specifies the VLAN priority value.


    filename (optional, str, None)
      Specifies the name of the file that is loaded by Trivial File Transfer Protocol (TFTP) from the BOOTP server.



  service (optional, list, None)
    Service boot list. The service list designates possible boot devices for when the system is booted in service mode.

    Mutually exclusive with *both*.


    device (True, str, None)
      Specifies the name of the specific or generic device to include in the boot list.

      The following generic device keywords are supported:

      ``fd`` specifies any standard I/O-attached diskette drive.

      ``scdisk`` specifies any SCSI-attached disk.

      ``badisk`` specifes any direct bus-attached disk.

      ``rmt`` specifies any SCSI-attached tape device.

      ``ent`` specifies any Ethernet adapter.

      ``tok`` specifies any Token-Ring adapter.

      ``fddi`` specifies any Fiber Distributed Data Interface adapter.


    blv (optional, str, None)
      Specifies the boot logical volume on the target disk that is to be included in the boot list.
