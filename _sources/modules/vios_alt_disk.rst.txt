vios_alt_disk -- Create/Cleanup an alternate rootvg disk on a VIOS
==================================================================

.. contents::
   :local:
   :depth: 1


Synopsis
--------

Copy the rootvg to an alternate disk or cleanup an existing one.



Requirements
------------
The below requirements are needed on the host that executes this module.

- AIX >= 7.1 TL3
- Python >= 2.7



Parameters
----------

  action (True, str, None)
    Specifies the operation to perform on the VIOS.

    ``alt_disk_copy`` to perform and alternate disk copy.

    ``alt_disk_clean`` to cleanup an existing alternate disk copy.


  targets (optional, list, None)
    Specifies the target disks.


  disk_size_policy (optional, str, nearest)
    Specifies how to choose the alternate disk if not specified.

    ``minimize`` smallest disk that can be selected.

    ``upper`` first disk found bigger than the rootvg disk.

    ``lower`` disk size less than rootvg disk size but big enough to contain the used PPs.

    ``nearest``


  force (optional, bool, False)
    Forces removal of any existing alternate disk copy on target disks.

    Stops any active rootvg mirroring during the alternate disk copy.





Notes
-----

.. note::
   - ``alt_disk_copy`` only backs up mounted file systems. Mount all file systems that you want to back up.
   - copy is performed only on one alternate hdisk even if the rootvg contains multiple hdisks
   - error if several ``altinst_rootvg`` exist for cleanup operation in automatic mode




Examples
--------

.. code-block:: yaml+jinja

    
    - name: Perform an alternate disk copy of the rootvg to hdisk1
      vios_alt_disk:
        action: alt_disk_copy
        targets: hdisk1

    - name: Perform an alternate disk copy of the rootvg to the smallest disk that can be selected
      vios_alt_disk:
        action: alt_disk_copy
        disk_size_policy: minimize

    - name: Perform a cleanup of any existing alternate disk copy
      vios_alt_disk:
        action: alt_disk_clean



Return Values
-------------

msg (always, str, VIOS alt disk operation completed successfully)
  The execution message.


stdout (always, str, Bootlist is set to the boot disk: hdisk0 blv=hd5)
  The standard output


stderr (always, str, )
  The standard error
