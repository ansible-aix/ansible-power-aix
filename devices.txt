- chtype
        Specifies the change type. `reboot' - Changes are applied to
        the device when the system is rebooted `current' - Changes the
        current state of the device temporarily `both' - Changes are

        (Choices: reboot, current, both)[Default: both]
        type: str

- device
        Specifies the device logical name in the Customized Devices

        [Default: all]
        type: str

- force
        Forces the change/unconfigure operation to take place on a
        locked device.
        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- parent_device
        While modifying device, specifies the parent device of the
        device to be updated. For unconfigure/stop operation,
        specifies the parent device whose children needs to be
        unconfigured recursively.
        [Default: (null)]
        type: str

- recursive
        Specifies to unconfigure the device and its children

        [Default: False]
        type: bool

- rmtype
        Specifies whether to unconfigure/stop the device.
        `unconfigure' - Changes are applied to the device when the

        (Choices: unconfigure, stop)[Default: unconfigure]
        type: str

- state
        Specifies the action to be performed on the device.
        `available' - If the device is in 'defined' state, configure
        device else change device attributes when in 'available' state
        `defined' - If the device is in 'available state',
        Unconfigure/Stop device else change device attributes when in
